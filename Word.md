Brownbags are a great platform and environment for professionals to speak about anything that interests them. 

The main problem I found was that there was no **easy to use** platform to see what Brownbags, Internal Training or other events are coming up or have already gone, so I created [Evento](https://github.com/boyney123/evento)

This free and opensource platform should allow any organisation or group to collect and share their events in one place.

If you would like to contribute to the project or folk it for your own organisation or group feel free.
